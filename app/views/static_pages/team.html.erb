        <h1>The Team</h1>

        <h2>Noelle Celeste</h2>
        <p class="job-title">Director of Engagement</p>
        <p>Noelle is a Yale graduate who returned home to Northeast Ohio as a community organizer, development consultant and social entrepreneur.

Noelle is a board member or founder of several recent community start-ups, including Bulldogs on the Cuyahoga and Cleveland Colectivo.</p>
        <p>Explaining why she joined the project, Noelle says, "I like working on challenging new ideas with amazing people and Civic Commons has the potential to support the work of so many great people. Plus, I wanted to challenge myself to get to know my region well beyond Cuyahoga County, which judged by the number of miles I'm putting on my car is definitely the case with this gig."</p>

        <h2>Dan Moulthrop</h2>
        <p class="job-title">Curator of Conversation</p>
        <p>An award-winning journalist, author, former teacher and a California transplant, Dan joined the Civic Commons after five years at ideastream as host of 90.3 WCPN's The Sound of Ideas.

Dan is the co-author (with Ninive Calegari and Dave Eggers) of Teachers Have it Easy: The Big Sacrifices and Small Salaries of America’s Teachers(New Press, 2005), a book that foreshadowed the current national debate over teacher accountability and compensation. </p>
        <p>Dan joined The Civic Commons because "it's an opportunity to figure out how to make journalism more relevant to more people and to bring those people into the conversations that have the power to make our corner of the state a little stronger. How could I not want to be a part of that?"</p>

        <h2>Jerry D'Antonio</h2>
        <p class="job-title">Director of Software Development</p>
        <p>Jerry has been helping to build the web since the mid-90’s. He experienced both the boom and the bust of the Internet bubble first hand. It was the bust that brought Jerry back to the region of his early youth and he now happily resides in Akron. During his time as a software developer Jerry has worked at small startups and big established companies; he has worked with tools from all the big names including Microsoft, Sun/Oracle, and Apple as well as numerous open source technologies; he has built web sites in industries as diverse as education, banking, and public broadcasting. Most recently Jerry worked as the Director of Web Technology at WVIZ/PBS &amp; 90.3 WCPN ideastream where he helped develop the current web strategy and directed the design and construction of their current web infrastructure. Jerry also holds part-time faculty positions at two universities where he teaches software engineering at the graduate and undergraduate level. Jerry is a proud veteran of the US Navy where he was stationed on the amphibious ship USS Duluth LPD-6.</p>
        <p>When asked why he joined the project Jerry responded, “The Civic Commons is the perfect intersection of two of my passions: building the web and promoting my community. Akron is my home. My wife and I believe strongly in the responsibility of every citizen to make their home a better place. Managing the web/software development team at the Civic Commons allows me to help build something I believe will be of great benefit to Akron and the entire NE Ohio region.”</p>
